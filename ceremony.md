# Processional (Russell)

# Welcome (Baylis)
Hello everybody, please have a seat. I am delighted to welcome all of you to the wedding of two of our dearest friends: Emma Dobbins and Sam Kanner. My name is Patrick, and I'm lucky enough to have been a friend to both of Emma and Sam for more than ten years.

# Community Good Vibes / relaying message from Emma and Sam (Patrick)
Words can't express how special it is to have you so many of our friends and family with us as we do this thing. But we'll try. In our lives, we've been incredibly lucky to have grown up with such strong communities surrounding us. From high school in Portland and Amherst, to college at Carleton, to life in the bay area, we've had so many friends become like family to us. Shoot, we must have lived with at least 25 of you, and the rest of you have spent at least a night on our couch. Our families, too, have given us incredible support over the years, and we're delighted that so many of you have made the trip out here. We want you to know your love and friendship mean the world to us, and that we wouldn't be who we are and that our relationship wouldn't be what it is without the wonderful people we've had around us for so many years. So, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you!

# About Sam and Emma (Patrick) (3-5 minutes)
As a condition of my performing this marriage, you all now have to listen to me talk about Sam and Emma. I can tell you the exact moment I knew that Sam and Emma were going to get married. Years ago, when we lived together in Oakland, I was sitting in the living room on this really nice Sunday afternoon when I heard giggling coming from the kitchen. Usually, that means that Sam found something to eat. So, being hungry, I went to take a look. And I remember poking my head in and they're just sitting there, working on a crossword puzzle together, and kind of just laughing at, well, not very much.

There are a lot of models of good relationships out there. One of things that makes the relationship that Sam and Emma have feel really special to me is the way their love for each other has grown up within the context of this community of friends that they have. When you spend time with them, you never feel closed out by their "coupleness".  Their being together is always something that adds to the richness of your interaction with them.

As most of you - especially the familes - know, both Sam and Emma are fiercely independent people. We'll be here for days if I list off all of their qualities, but I want to highlight a few. Emma, though she'll deny it, has the highest emotional intelligence of anyone I know. She can sense when people are hurting, and how to gently ask the right question to draw them out. Sam is one of the most steadfast, quietly supportive men I know. He'll take care of things without mention or complaint.

They're not perfect, either. Emma can turn into a white-hot ball of stress, and anyone who has ever tried to go somewhere with Sam knows that at some point he's likely to take off, leaving you behind. But part of their partnership has been the way that they improve each other.

[Advice to the couple? Don't really wanna... ]
